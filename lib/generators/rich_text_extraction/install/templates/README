## üóëÔ∏è Cleanup

You can safely delete the example files once you've integrated RichTextExtraction into your own models:
- `app/models/example_post.rb`
- `app/controllers/example_posts_controller.rb`
- `app/views/example_posts/show.html.erb`
- `app/jobs/process_links_job.rb`

The configuration files should be kept and customized for your needs.

Happy extracting! üéØ
