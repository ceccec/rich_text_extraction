# Deployment Guide: DRY/Automated Platform

This guide explains how to deploy your platform and what to expect from the automated workflow.

---

## 1. Static Hosting

- Deploy the `docs/` directory to GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages.
- For GitHub Pages:
  - Set source to `/docs` in repo settings.
  - (Optional) Add a custom domain and enable HTTPS.

## 2. CI/CD Workflow

- Every push/PR triggers all CI checks and syncs.
- If all checks pass, your site is auto-deployed.
- All generated files (CSS, JS, JSON) are kept in sync with YAML/JSON sources.

## 3. API Docs

- Serve Swagger UI or Redoc from `docs/api/` for live API documentation.

## 4. Monitoring & Quality

- Review CI status and reports (Lighthouse, a11y, visual, etc.) after each deploy.
- Use analytics (e.g., Plausible) to monitor usage.

## 5. Rollbacks & Previews

- Netlify/Vercel: Every PR gets a preview URL; rollbacks are one click.
- GitHub Pages: Revert to a previous commit if needed.
