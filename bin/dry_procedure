# --- DRY Procedure: Make the app minimal, self-sufficient, and ready for automated deployment ---

# 1. Minimize dependencies (edit Gemfile to keep only essentials)
#    (Manual step: already done, but can be scripted with sed/awk if needed)

# 2. Install dependencies
bundle install
npm install

# 3. Generate docs and tests from YAML/JSON source of truth
bin/generate_validator_docs.rb
bin/generate_scenario_tests.rb

# 4. Run tests to ensure full functionality
bundle exec rspec

# 5. Check health endpoint
curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || echo 'Health check failed!'

# 6. Check OpenAPI endpoint
curl -f http://localhost:3000/openapi.json || echo 'OpenAPI endpoint failed!'

# 7. Print completion message

echo "DRY procedure complete: app is minimal, self-sufficient, and ready for automated deployment."
